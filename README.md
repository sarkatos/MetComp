# Computational Physics – UFRGS

This repository contains the material developed and used during my undergraduate studies in Physics with an emphasis in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).

## 📘 Overview

The content is centered around the topics covered in Computational Physics courses and includes:

- 📓 **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks** with clear explanations and practical implementations.
- 🧮 **Python-based code** focusing on numerical methods and physical problem-solving.
- 📝 **Solved exercises and exams**, which illustrate typical applications of computational techniques.

> ⚠️ Note: The solutions to the exams were written during class and under time constraints, so they might not be as thoroughly explained as the notebooks.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Common libraries used:
  - `NumPy`
  - `Matplotlib`
  - `SciPy`
  - `Pandas` (in some cases)
