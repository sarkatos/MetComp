# Computational Physics – UFRGS

This repository contains material developed and used during my undergraduate studies in Physics with an emphasis in Astrophysics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS).

## 📘 Overview

The content is based on topics covered in Computational Physics courses and includes:

- 📓 **Interactive and explanatory Jupyter Notebooks**  
  Covering numerical methods and physical applications using Python.
- 🧮 **Code implementations in Python**  
  Focused on solving problems in physics and astrophysics.
- 📝 **Solved exercises and exams**  
  These illustrate practical applications.  
  > ⚠️ *Note: Exam solutions were written under time constraints during class, so explanations may be brief or incomplete.*

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook

Common libraries used:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `pandas` (occasionally)

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` – Explanatory and interactive Jupyter notebooks  
- `exercises/` – Solved exercises  
- `exams/` – Solved tests and assignments  
- `README.md` – This file  

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves as both a personal study archive and a resource for those interested in learning how computational methods are applied to problems in Physics and Astrophysics.
